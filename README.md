# Distributed Systems Principles and Paradigms

## 1. Definition
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to the users of the system as a single coherent system. (Tanenbaum and Van Steen, 2007)

## 2. Goals
Distributed systems have several key characteristics that set them apart from other types of systems. Some of the most important characteristics of distributed systems include:
- **Make Resources Accessible**: make it easier for users to access resources, such as files, databases, and applications, from any location.
- **Distribution Transparency**: the system should behave as if all resources were located at a single site.
- **Openness**: the system should be open to new resources and technologies.
- **Scalability**: the system should be able to grow and shrink as needed.
